`README.md` for version 1.0 of my zsh config.

## Introduction ##
This script installs and configures Oh-My-Zsh that adds Zsh two fish-like
features and a powerline theme, the only thing left to the user,
is to install a powerline patched font and apply the
solarized dark color scheme to the terminal 

## Installation ##
The installation is very simple, just clone this repo and run the script:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ZenTauro/My-Zsh-.git && ./My-Zsh-Config/my-zsh-config.sh 
```

## Disclaimer ##
This is pretty much a personal project so it optimal
performance is not expected. Also, this is the first script that I have written so do it at
your own risk
